There are many project management applications available online (Traditional & Cloud based), which helps organisations to keep track of project's progress, included task's control, sharing documents among employees working on these projects and produce customized reports providing management an overall picture of project's status.<br>
In this scenario, where tens of applications are already available providing almost every functionality a user would need for project management, the idea and need for an application for same purpose arose because of the following reasons.

* Need for simplicity.
* Too much view switching within the application.
* Lacking current technologies utilization.

To solve mentioned discrepancies. Following are the missing features we identified for implementation.

* Simplicity.
* Single page application (SPA).
* Desktop applications like interface.
* Use of latest web tools and frameworks to achieve current and modern look and functionalities.

By looking at the aforementioned points, it's clear that we saw these aspects missing in applications which are already available. Our main goal in this project was to develop an application as simplistic as possible for a topic as complex as project management system. We tried to achieve this by providing most of the functionalities in a single view, which means without having to load separate views for working with separate logical entities involved (Projects, Tasks, Documents, Users). We provided CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) of logical entities in a single view using multiple modal windows like in a desktop application. From administration, CRUD and search options, to chatting with employees, users find all these facilities in one single view, making the application a lot simpler, less confusing and easy to learn and work with.
